# Heading Lesson 1

The document is the basic unit of data in MongoDB.

A collection is a grouping of those documents.

Database is a container for our collections.

In MongoDB documents are displayed in JSON but stored in BSON.

BSON is an extension of JSON that supports additional data types like dates, numbers of various types and ObjectIds.

ObjectIds is the unique identifier for the required ID field.

MongoDB's data model supports polymorphic data but we can always constraint the structure using an schema validation.
